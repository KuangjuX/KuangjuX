<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm KuangjuX ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

Hi, my name is Chengxiang Qi. I am currently a second-year master student in computer science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I completed my undergraduate studies at Tianjin University. My current interests are in deep learning compilers, machine learning systems, and deep learning. In the past, I have also been interested in the Rust programming language and its applications at the system level (OS, Hypervisor, etc.). I am currently interning at Wechat LLM Infra Team.

In the past, I was a research intern in the MSRA System Group, where I focused on two projects:

- [microsoft/TileFusion](https://github.com/microsoft/TileFusion) is an experimental C++ macro kernel template library that elevates the abstraction level in CUDA C for tile processing.
- [microsoft/FractalTensor](https://github.com/microsoft/FractalTensor) is a programming framework that introduces a novel approach to organizing data in deep neural networks (DNNs) as a list of lists of statically-shaped tensors, referred to as a FractalTensor.

During my time at MSRA, I was very fortunate to work with my mentor @[lcy-seso](https://github.com/lcy-seso), who is a very idealistic and capable researcher!

Before I joined the MSRA system group, I interned at the Operating System Laboratory of Tsinghua University, where I focused on Type-2 hypervisors and network performance on arceos:

- [arceos-org/arceos](https://github.com/arceos-org/arceos) is an experimental modular OS written in Rust. I added **hypervisor** feature, support for ixgbg 82599 NIC driver and optimized network performance.
- [hypercraft](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypercraft) is a VMM library written in Rust. It was developed from the hypocaust-2 project, with the main purpose of providing virtualization support for arceos and can be used as a standalone component.

I have done some interesting projects before:

- [xv6-rust](https://github.com/Ko-oK-OS/xv6-rust) is a reimplementation of the [mit-pdos/xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) operating system in the Rust programming language. It explores how to use Rust features to build an operating system that is as memory-safe as possible.
- [hypocaust-2](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypocaust-2) is a Type-2 hypervisor built in Rust programming language and it is my first attempt to use RISC-V H Extension.
- [hypocaust](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypocaust) is a Type-1 hypervisor that traps and emulates S-mode in Rust, inspired by [mit-pdos/RVirt](https://github.com/mit-pdos/RVirt).
