<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm KuangjuX ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

Hi, my name is Chengxiang Qi. I am currently a second-year master student in computer science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I completed my undergraduate studies at Tianjin University. My current interests are in deep learning compilers, machine learning systems, and deep learning. In the past, I have also been interested in the Rust programming language and its applications at the system level (OS, Hypervisor, etc.).

In the past, I was a research intern in the MSRA System Group, where I focused on two projects:

- [microsoft/TileFusion](https://github.com/microsoft/TileFusion) is an experimental C++ macro kernel template library that elevates the abstraction level in CUDA C for tile processing.
- [microsoft/FractalTensor](https://github.com/microsoft/FractalTensor) is a programming framework that introduces a novel approach to organizing data in deep neural networks (DNNs) as a list of lists of statically-shaped tensors, referred to as a FractalTensor.

Before I joined the MSRA system group, I interned at the Operating System Laboratory of Tsinghua University, where I focused on Type-2 hypervisors and network performance on arceos:

- [arceos-org/arceos](https://github.com/arceos-org/arceos) is an experimental modular OS written in Rust. I added **hypervisor** feature, support for ixgbg 82599 NIC driver and optimized network performance.
- [hypercraft](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypercraft) is a VMM library written in Rust. It was developed from the hypocaust-2 project, with the main purpose of providing virtualization support for arceos and can be used as a standalone component.
