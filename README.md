<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm KuangjuX ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

I am currently a first-year master's student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Previously, I graduated from Tianjin University with a bachelor's degree. I like system program in Rust. I am currently focusing on machine learning systems and AI compilers. 
I am studying [CMU 10-414/714 Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/) and working on implementing a cross-platform AI compiler.

I build operating systems in Rust:  

- [xv6-rust](https://github.com/Ko-oK-OS/xv6-rust): A reimplementation of xv6-riscv rust version.  
- [rCore-fat](https://github.com/KuangjuX/rCore-fat): rCore-Tutorial-v3 with fat32 file system.  
- [raspberrypi-embedded/mini-game-os](https://github.com/raspberrypi-embedded/mini-game-os): A small game os run on raspverry pi 4.

I also build hypervisor(VMM) in Rust:  
- [hypocaust](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypocaust): A S mode trap and emulate type-1 hypervisor run on RISC -V machine.
- [hypocaust-2](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypocaust-2): A hardware-assisted type-1 hypervisor with H extension run on RISC -V machine.
- [hypercraft](https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypercraft): ðŸš§WIPðŸš§ A VMM library written in Rust.
